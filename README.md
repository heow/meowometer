# meowometer

This is Heow Goodman's example of a non-trivial Heroku Application in under 100 lines of Code, including the GUI.  It was quickly written and used for his [2012 Clojure Conj Lighting Talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xaxF5RDdVRE).

It is online at [MeowOMeter.com](http://www.meowometer.com/).  TODO: fix the hotlinked background.

Basically the [code is just here](https://github.com/heow/meowometer/blob/master/src/meowometer/web.clj).
